# MAGIC # Social Determinants of Health (SDH)
# MAGIC Many aspects of a person's life style and status can impact health outcomes. Multiple studies suggest that Social Determinents of Health (SDH) account for between 30-55% of health outcomes. 
# MAGIC [The WHO defines SDH as]((https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health#tab=tab_1):
# MAGIC >.. the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, <br>
# MAGIC > grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. <br>
# MAGIC > These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social <br>

# MAGIC Correlation between SDH and health outcomes is very clear: the lower the socioeconomic position, the worse the health, which in turn creates a negative feedback loop (poor health resulting in poor socioeconomic status) which results in widening the gap even more. 
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC There are many public sources of SDH data with different levels of granularity (country level, state/province, county, or zipcode/postal code level) that can be used in analysis of the impact of SDH on health outcomes. One of the main challenges for data analysis is finding the right data source and data cleaning.
